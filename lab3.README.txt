Using the spinning cube as a reference I worked the math out to find the points of a new 3d image and rendered it in a 3D space
using document.onkeyup and down to check for keyboard input which called a function allowing the orientation of the shape to be 
changed. The object was shading using a custom function called tri which took account of the vertices and worked out the math 
taking the inputs of various vertices in the shapes to create a properly shaded 3 dimensional object.
